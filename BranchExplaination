//This Branch exists to allow us to change and alter the code grammer without affecting the overall program until decided upon
//later.

//This allows us to make the code, javadoc, and or files appear to make more sense at a glance verse having to delve into them
// to understand what is going on. This is not to be merged with the master branch UNLESS everyone agrees upon doing so.
// My suggestion to those reading this is to make a branch of this one (in a sense) to make changes you desire, making it easier
// for others to review it.
